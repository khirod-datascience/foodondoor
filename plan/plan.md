## 1. Core Principles & Architecture
- **Custom User System**: No Django built-in User/auth; use custom profile models (customer, vendor, delivery) with custom JWT/OTP logic.
- **Tech Stack**: Django (REST API), PostgreSQL (MongoDB-ready), Flutter (3 apps), FCM for push notifications.
- **Modular Apps**: `auth_app`, `customer_app`, `vendor_app`, `delivery_app`, `core`.
- **RESTful APIs**: JWT auth, FCM, real-time features (WebSockets for tracking/support in future).
- **Documentation**: Maintain `api_endpoints.md` and `work_summary.md` for all changes and endpoints.
